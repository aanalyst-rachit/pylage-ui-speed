# PyLage UI Kit — Popover

## Purpose

The UI Kit Popover recipe provides a stable higher-level API around the existing PyLage `Popover` component.

## Architecture

Popover is implemented as a thin WRAP recipe. The UI Kit does not introduce a new renderer, overlay engine, positioning system, reactive mechanism, or JavaScript behavior.

The recipe delegates directly to the existing PyLage `Popover` component.

## API

```python
from pylage.UI.recipes import popover

popover(
    Text("Popover content"),
    title="Additional information",
    class_name="ui-kit-popover",
)
```

The recipe accepts arbitrary children and forwards supported properties to the existing core component.

## Existing Core Contract

The underlying PyLage `Popover` renders as a `<div>` and currently supports `class_name` and `title` through the existing registry contract.

No core Popover implementation was duplicated or modified.

## Regression Coverage

Coverage includes:

- core Popover rendering
- core Popover properties
- core Popover children
- UI Kit wrapper rendering
- UI Kit property forwarding
- UI Kit child preservation
- public recipe export
- recipe audit compatibility

Focused verification completed with **19 tests passed** across the recipe audit and Popover tests.

## Manual Verification

`app/ui_kit_popover_manual.py` was added to verify the UI Kit recipe through the normal PyLage application runtime.

Manual browser verification confirmed that the Popover examples render correctly and preserve their children and properties.

## Design Boundary

The UI Kit intentionally does not create custom Popover behavior. Existing PyLage behavior remains the source of truth.

## Phase Status

Popover is complete as a Phase 09 Feedback & Overlays item.

Phase 09 remains incomplete until all Phase 09 items are finished. Toast remains unresolved/on hold unless explicitly requested.

## Workflow
